### Latest Release: [v2.0](https://github.com/tonyleelyy/OpenCore-Hackintosh-Dell-G3-3579/releases/tag/v2.0)

**macOS Version: 10.15.4 19E287**

**OpenCore Version: [0.5.7 Offical](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases/tag/0.5.7)**

This OpenCore hackintosh repo is made for i5-8300H, GTX1050, no USB Type-C version of Dell G3 3579.

> I will try to update this project as fast as possible, which means it will be adapted to the latest version of OpenCore and macOS
>
> Although the project has been completely separated from the support of [CerteKim](https://github.com/CerteKim)'s [Dell-G3-3579-Hackintosh-OpenCore](https://github.com/CerteKim/Dell-G3-3579-Hackintosh-OpenCore), but I still want to thank him. Without his support there would be no such project.
